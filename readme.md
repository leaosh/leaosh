# Hi there,

I'm a software engineer working mainly in the back-end and focused in information security, who values ​​ethics and excellence in solutions. I also develop and enjoy getting involved in other parts and areas of Software Engineering, such as front-end, mobile, desktop and embedded. As a self-taught person, I like to learn new things all the time and use these learnings to build new projects and solve problems.

Enjoy your stay!
